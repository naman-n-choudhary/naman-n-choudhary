## 👤 Who Am I?
A builder obsessed with systems - market systems, engineering systems, and business systems.  
I combine **Quant Finance + Engineering + Decision Science** to design tools that help traders, analysts, and operators think clearly and execute efficiently.

---

## 💡 What I’m Really Good At
- **Quant Thinking** - breaking complexity into models, regimes, probabilities  
- **Market Logic** - volatility understanding, liquidity intuition, risk sizing  
- **Analytical Engineering** - building systems that actually work under constraints  
- **Excel Mastery** - advanced modelling, automation, data cleaning, dashboards  
- **Python Workflow Building** - fast prototyping, data pipelines, financial logic  
- **Problem Solving Under Pressure** - hackathons, trading, system design  
- **End-to-End Execution** - idea → model → code → dashboard → documentation  

These are **core strengths**, not tools.

## 🛠 My Toolkit
**Finance & Quant:** HMM, Time Series, Volatility Modelling, Regime Detection, Portfolio Math  
**Data:** Python, Excel (Advanced), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Engineering:** ESP32, MATLAB, IoT Prototyping, Sensor Logic  
**Trading Tools:** Position sizing, risk engines, scenario modelling  
**Soft Skills:** Decision-making, structuring complexity, fast learning

## 🚀 Projects That Represent Me
- **Market Regime Engine** - HMM + liquidity logic for macro regime detection  
- **Digital Payments Compliance Engine** - anomaly detection for UPI/RTGS  
- **Inflation Forecasting System** - CPI/WPI forecasting with SARIMA  
- **MRAS** - multi-regime alpha system (TF + MR + Panic Reversal)  
- **Advanced Excel Models** - valuation sheets, scenario planners, calculators  
- **Hardware Builds** - ESP32 gaming controller, Peltier fridge prototype  

These showcase: **logic, structure, system thinking, and execution**.

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For
To become the **perfect hybrid**:  
Quant mindset → Engineering execution → Entrepreneurial decision-making.
